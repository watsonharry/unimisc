Some other University work

'Neighbours' was an optimisation problem, where we were given an unoptimised script for a problem and asked to improve it. Our code was required to complete in less than 12 seconds.

"The script provided generates N random positions within a periodic unit cube. The program
prompts the user to input both the number of points, N, and the seed to be used by the
random number generator. Using the same N and seed ensures the same distribution of
random points. Once the random positions have been generated a timer is started and the
routine then finds the nearest neighbour of every point (in a periodic way, i.e. a point near
one side of the cube may be close to a point adjacent to the opposite side). Once this
process has been completed the timer is stopped and the elapsed time displayed. If the
script has been run before with the same number of particles and random number seed a
self-check is then performed to ensure the correct list of nearest neighbours has been found"
